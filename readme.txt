WP-Table Reloaded enables you to create and manage tables in your WP's admin area. No HTML knowledge is needed. A comfortable backend allows to easily edit table data. You can include the tables into your posts, on your pages or in text widgets by using a shortcode or a template tag function. Tables can be imported and exported from/to CSV, XML and HTML.

The plugin is a completely rewritten and extended version of Alex Rabe's "wp-Table" and uses the state-of-the-art WordPress techniques which makes it faster and lighter than the original plugin. You may also have both plugins installed at the same time and you can also import your tables from the wp-Table plugin!

== Installation ==

The easiest way is through your WordPress Admin area. Go to the plugin section and search for "WP-Table Reloaded" in the WordPress Plugin Directory. Then you can click "Install" and the following steps will be done for you automatically. You just have to activate the plugin (step 5).

Manual Installation works just as for most other WordPress plugins:

1. Download and Extract the zip file and just drop the folder "wp-table-reloaded" into the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation.

1. Activate the Plugin "WP-Table Reloaded" on your "Plugins" page.

1. Create and manage tables via "WP-Table Reloaded" in the "Tools" section.

1. Include a table by adding the shortcode [table id=&lt;your-table's-id&gt; /] to your post, page or text widget.

1. You might want to add styling features via your blog's theme's CSS file (probably style.css) or via the option in the "Plugin Options" screen, where you can enter your CSS directly.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use wp-Table and WP-Table Reloaded together? =

Yes! You can have both wp-Table and WP-Table Reloaded installed in your WordPress! They will not interfere (as they are not using anything together). They are completely independent from each other.
If WP-Table Reloaded finds the wp-Table database tables, it can import the found tables into it's own format, so that you can completely upgrade from wp-Table to WP-Table Reloaded.

= Support? =

If you find a bug or have a feature request, please don't hesitate to tell me about it.
You would help a lot if you could add an issue ticket in the [issue tracker on Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/wp-table-reloaded/).
Feature requests may also posted in the comments on the plugin website.

For other help or support questions (especially with CSS), please use the [WordPress Support Forums](http://wordpress.org/support/). Please [open a new topic](http://wordpress.org/tags/wp-table-reloaded?forum_id=10#postform) there (with the tag "wp-table-reloaded") and email me a link to the thread (or post it as a comment on the plugin website). Thank you!
You may also make feature requests using this method! Don't be shy!

= Requirements? =

In short: WordPress 2.8 or higher

= Languages and Localization? =

The plugin currently includes the following languages:
Albanian, Belorussian, Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, English, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.

I'd really appreciate it, if you would translate the plugin into your language! Using Heiko Rabe's WordPress plugin [Codestyling Localization](http://www.code-styling.de/english/development/wordpress-plugin-codestyling-localization-en/) that really is as easy as pie. Just install the plugin, add your language, create the .po-file, translate the strings in the comfortable editor and create the .mo-file. It will automatically be saved in WP-Table Reloaded's plugin folder. If you send me the .mo- and .po-file, I will gladly include them into future plugin releases.
There is also a .pot-file available to use in the "languages" subfolder.

= Where can I get more information? =

Please visit the [official plugin website](http://tobias.baethge.com/wordpress-plugins/wp-table-reloaded-english/) for the latest information on this plugin.

Die Webseite des Plugins ist auch [auf Deutsch](http://tobias.baethge.com/wordpress-plugins/wp-table-reloaded-deutsch/) verf&uuml;gbar.

== Usage ==

After installing the plugin, you can add, import, export, edit, copy, delete, ... tables via the "WP-Table Reloaded" screen which appears under the "Tools" section in your Admin menu.
Everything should be self-explaining there.

To show one of your tables in a post, on a page or in a text widget, just include the shortcode [table id=&lt;the-id&gt; /] to your post/page/text-widget, where &lt;the-id&gt is the ID of your table (can be found on the left side of the "List tables" screen.)

After that you might want to change the style of the table. You can do this either by adding CSS to your theme's CSS stylesheet (probably style.css) or by entering it into the box on the "Plugin Options" screen. There are two example styles available on the [plugin website](http://tobias.baethge.com/wordpress-plugins/wp-table-reloaded-english/#usage)
You may also add certain features (like table-sorting, alternating row colors, print name and/or description, ...) by checking the appropriate options in the "Edit table" screen.
